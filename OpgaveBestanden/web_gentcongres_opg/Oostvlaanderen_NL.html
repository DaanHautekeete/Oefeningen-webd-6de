<h1>Oost-Vlaanderen</h1>
<h2>Landscapes</h2>
<p>Ghent is the capital of East Flanders, a province interlaced with a blue network of rivers, canals, brooks and ponds. Ghent, the heart of this network, is located at the confluence of the rivers Scheldt and Lys.
  Today the East Flemish waterways are important economic axes. Through the ages, they have shaped the landscape. In the Middle Ages, when the banks gave way as a result of storm tides, vast areas in the north of the province were flooded. When the sea withdrew, the creeks remained as silent witnesses of the uncontrollable force of nature.
  To the south of Ghent, fast flowing rivers carve out deep valleys in a wonderfully green landscape called &lsquo;the Flemish Ardennes&rsquo;. Oudenaarde is the jewel in the crown of this region: after Ghent, 
    it is the second cultural-historical town of East Flanders and today it is an important economic centre.
  In the region to the east of Ghent ornamental plant cultivation is omnipresent. This is where the world-famous azaleas and begonias are grown. They are the pride and joy of the Ghent Flower Show, which is held every five years. The next edition of the so-called Floralies of Ghent will take place in 2015.
  To the west of Ghent, the river Lys meanders through a scenic landscape, which has inspired many artists. You can admire their work in several museums in and around Ghent.</p>
<h2>Arts and culture</h2>
<p>Roger Raveel is one of the most prominent contemporary artists in Belgium. The museum in Machelen-aan-de-Leie, which is entirely dedicated to his work, leaves a lasting impression on the visitor. Roger Raveel is an exponent of the &lsquo;Leie artists&rsquo; who found inspiration in the picturesque banks of this river. Still their work was by no means corny and unimaginative, but always innovative and trend-setting.</p>
<p>Many of the most magnificent castles were built near rivers. This is also the case in East Flanders. In a bend of the river Lys, 
    15 kilometres from Ghent, stands the Castle Ooidonk. It is an
    exquisite example of sixteenth-century Hispano-Flemish architecture, which would not be out of place on the banks of the river Loire. At the other side of Ghent, among the flower greenhouses, stands the Castle of Laarne: a magnificent medieval water castle which 
    contains a remarkable collection of silverware.</p>
<p>Today Oudenaarde is a thriving economic centre. In the industrial estate &lsquo;Bruwaan&rsquo; there are many textile firms. This is also where Samsonite has its European headquarters. Oudenaarde was a prominent town in the Middle Ages. The Late Gothic town hall with adjacent cloth makers&rsquo; hall is one of the finest in the country. The town hall hosts a permanent exhibition of renowned tapestries made in Oudenaarde and a unique collection of silver ware.</p>
<h2>Mercators hometown</h2>
<p>Rupelmonde lies halfway between Ghent and Antwerp, on the river Scheldt. It is where Mercator, the famous cartographer and designer of the first maps of the world and terrestrial globes, used to live. He has his own museum in Sint-Niklaas. Gerard Mercator is born 500 years ago. Therefore 2012 proclaimed the Mercator year that is celebrated with numerous international and national events.</p>
<h2>Waterside recreation</h2>
<p>The province of East Flanders boasts more than 400 kilometres of navigable waterways. The jewel in the crown of this network of waterways is Portus Ganda, the yacht basin in the historic centre of Ghent. The city is upgrading more and more local waterways as well as the residential and commercial neighbourhoods along those waterways.</p>
<p>Guided boat trips are available In several cities on the waterfront. You can also hire a yacht for a day or even several weeks, or steer your own boat. Sports lovers can go kayaking on the Dender or the Lys, or they can choose for a 35 kilometre round trip on the Moervaart and the Zuidlede.</p>
<h2>Gastronomy</h2>
<p>First-class restaurants can be found all over the province with a high concentration of restaurants with a Michelin star in Scheldeland, the region east of Ghent.</p>
<p>Peter Goossens, chef at Hof van Cleve in Kruishoutem, about 20 kilometres south of Ghent, may pride himself in having three Michelin stars.</p>
<p>East Flanders is also well-known for its excellent beers. Wherever you go, you will discover small, traditional breweries. Many of those beers, such as Delirium Tremens, Malheur 12° and Tripel Karmeliet, have won several international awards. These breweries but also gin distilleries and many other companies are worth visiting.
  You can have a taste of several other well-known East Flemish regional products in the &lsquo;Groot Vleeshuis&rsquo; (Butchers&rsquo; Hall) at the Groentenmarkt in Ghent: local gin, ham, bacon, cheese, chocolate, gingerbread, …</p>
<h2>Walking and cycling in East Flanders</h2>
<p>In East-Flanders it is possible to explore the whole province along bicycle intersections. By connecting the various intersections, you can map out your individual bicycle tour. You use a map featuring the numbered intersections, list all the numbers and just follow the signposts from one numbered intersection to the next. The combinations are virtually endless and you can make these cycling trips as long or as short as you like.
  In the Flemish Ardennes you can walk along the 'Getuigenheuvels Vlaamse Ardennen' (Buttes of the Flemish Ardennes) a walking network that offers over 300 kilomteres of walking pleasure in a magical and varied region of rolling hills and valleys. Equal to the cycle network, you can plan your own walk from junction to junction as you explore Flanders&rsquo; most beautiful landscape.</p>
<p>During your walk you can use your smartphone (with internet connection and GPS) to check some information of the points of interest nearby. The augmented reality application is only available in Dutch and French.
In addition, there are some hundred fully signposted, looped cycling and walking routes traversing the scenic landscape of East Flanders. In the north through polders and past creeks, in the south up and down the hills of the Flemish Ardennes.</p>
<h2>Tour of Flanders</h2>
<p>You can also follow the route of the notorious bicycle race called the &lsquo;Tour of Flanders&rsquo;. The entire route is signposted and described in a brochure. Do not forget to visit the &lsquo;Tour of Flanders Centre&rsquo; 
    in Oudenaarde, an interactive museum where you learn all about this famous cycling classic. The finish of the 'Tour of Flanders' is situated in Oudenaarde.</p>
